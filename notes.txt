/**
\mainpage TinyXPath documentation

This is the first useful version of TinyXPath.\n

Usage :\n
In order to use TinyXPath, one need to link all the sourcecode files with every project, except :
- main.cpp
- htmlutil.h
- htmlutil.cpp
The main.cpp source file is the only one that one shouldn't include. It is mainly there to show a basic usage
of the XPath processor.\n
There will be libraries later on.\n

In order to compute an XPath expression, one need to :
-# instanciate the xpath_processor class, giving the constructor a source (Tiny) XML tree and an XPath expression. 
-# Call xpath_processor::er_compute_xpath. This delivers the XPath result. 

As an alternative if you know beforehand what result type you're looking for, you can use the following alternate 
member functions at step 2 :
- xpath_processor::S_compute_xpath : returns a string
- xpath_processor::i_compute_xpath : returns a single integer
- xpath_processor::u_compute_xpath_node_set : returns the number of nodes in the node set. The node set should be retrieved by calls to 
 - xpath_processor::v_get_xpath_base
 - xpath_processor::XNp_get_xpath_node
 or 
 - xpath_processor::XAp_get_xpath_attribute

once again, the choice of v_get_xpath_base or its two alternates depend if you know whether you know if you 
wait for an attribute or another type of node, or not.

\n Be aware that the input tree is modified after the call : all user data (TiXmlNode::SetUserData)
are replaced by the document order (XPath meaning).
